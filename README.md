# Cryptocurrencies
The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies classified by group according to their features.

In this assignment, we use the following for analysis:

* Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
